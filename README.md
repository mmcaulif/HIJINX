# High-Jinx; A practical introduction to deep learning using Jax and the Jax ecosystem

## To-do list:
Deep learning:
* Make a multi batch mnist version, and then a convolutional example
* Have a higher level classifier with more necessary augmentations

General:
* Think of ideas for more examples, aim for ~10-15 including some reinforcement learning ones
* Begin the write up intro 

Reinforcement Learning:
* Implement minimal versions of dqn and a2c in cartpole
* Improve further with new new libraries and augmentations to try and solve atari environments
